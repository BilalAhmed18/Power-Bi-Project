# Project Overview

Atliq Hardware, a leading consumer electronics company with global operations, is experiencing rapid growth. However, their reliance on Excel files for data analytics is proving to be inefficient and ineffective in generating insights.

To remedy this, I've implemented a Power BI dashboard, offering a streamlined and effective solution to enhance data analysis and decision-making processes.

## Key Insights

In this project, I've broken down the complex business data into five easy-to-understand views:

- **Finance View:** Here, we look at important numbers (KPIs) and elements of the P & L Statement. We identify the best and worst products and customers for each element of the P & L Statement.

- **Sales View and Marketing View:** We dive into how well customers and products are doing. We evaluate and visualize key figures like Net Sales and Gross Margin, making it easy to spot trends. We will also give you insights into unit economics and marketing trends.

- **Supply Chain View:** This view focuses on metrics like forecast accuracy, Net Error, ABS Error, and risk factors for customers and products. It helps you understand trends in Net error and forecast accuracy.

- **Executive View:** This one's for the big bosses! It provides essential metrics for senior executives to make decisions. We cover key data for subzones, AtliQ market share, top customers and products by revenue, and revenue breakdown by divisions and channels.
